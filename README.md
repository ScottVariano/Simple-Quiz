# Simple-Quiz
A very simple, self-contained quiz theme for WordPress that lets you build small, fun quizzes.

[View the Demo](http://variano.site/)

## Plugins Used
This plugin was built using Advanced Custom Fields Pro. The code could be modified to be used with the standard version, but would just be a bit less flexible when setting up quizzes (due to lack of build-in repeater fields).

WordPress REST API (Version 2) and ACF to REST API (Version 2) were also used to check answers via AJAX.

## CSS Styles
Some of the CSS was borrowed from Atakan Goktepe's ["Multi Step Form" demo](http://codepen.io/atakan/pen/gqbIz) and Angela Velasquez's ["CSS Styling Radio Button" demo](http://codepen.io/AngelaVelasquez/pen/Eypnq) on Codepen.
