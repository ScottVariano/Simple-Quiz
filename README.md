A very simple, self-contained quiz theme for WordPress that lets you build small, fun quizzes.

# Plugins Used
This plugin was built using Advanced Custom Fields Pro. The code could be modified to be used with the standard version, but would just be a bit less flexible when setting up quizzes (due to lack of build-in repeater fields).

WordPress REST API (Version 2) and ACF to REST API (Version 2) were also used to check answers via AJAX.
